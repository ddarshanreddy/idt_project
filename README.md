Multipurpose Double-Ended Travel Cutlery

This project presents a compact, reusable, and eco-friendly double-ended travel cutlery designed for people who eat on the go. It combines two essential utensils (such as spoon–fork or spoon–knife) into a single tool, reducing the need to carry multiple items and minimizing the use of disposable plastic cutlery.

The design focuses on portability, hygiene, comfort, and sustainability. Food-grade materials like stainless steel and polypropylene ensure durability, safety, and easy cleaning. User testing showed good comfort, balance, and acceptance, making the product suitable for travel, office use, and outdoor activities.

Overall, the project demonstrates a practical solution that promotes convenience and environmentally responsible living.
